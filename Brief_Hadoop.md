## Brief information about Hadoop
### Definition:  
Hadoop is an open source software platform for distributed storage and  
distributed processing of very large datasets on computer clusters built from  commodity 
hardware-Hortonworks  
  
### Hadoop cluster architecture:  
- Hadoop Distributed File System(HDFS): Namenode, Secondary namenode, datanode  
- Yarn: resource manager, nodemanager  
  
### Manage a hadoop cluster:  
- Command line  
- Ambari  
- HortonWorks  
  
### Why hadoop?  
data is too big(Volume, Velocity, Variety, Veracity)  
Vertical scaling issues like processing time, hardware failures  
Flexible  
Cost effective
