## Brief information about Hadoop
### Definition:  
Hadoop is an open source software platform for distributed storage and  
distributed processing of very large datasets on computer clusters built from  commodity 
hardware-Hortonworks  
  
### Hadoop cluster architecture:  
- Hadoop Distributed File System(HDFS):  
  - Allows us to distribute the storage of data across cluster of computers  
  - Maintains redundant copies of data  
- Yarn:  
  - Where data processing come into play.System that manages the resources on cluster  
  - Manages nodes and share work load between nodes  
  
  
### Manage a hadoop cluster:  
- Command line  
- Ambari  
- HortonWorks  
  
### Why hadoop?  
data is too big(Volume, Velocity, Variety, Veracity)  
Vertical scaling issues like processing time, hardware failures  
Flexible  
Cost effective
