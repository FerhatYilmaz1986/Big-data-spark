# Handling Big Data with Spark  
  
### What is Spark?  
  Spark is defined as "a fast and general engine for large-scale data processing" in Spark's website. It is built around one main  
  concept: Resilient Distributed Dataset(RDD)  
    
### Advantages of Spark:  
   - Power and speed

   - Language flexibility(python,java,scala)  
   - Faster than map/reduce  
   - Scalibility  
     
### Components of Spark:

   - Spark Streaming : Process live streaming data    
   - Spark Sql : Run queries on Hadoop deployment    
   - Mllib : Machine learning lbraries built on top of Spark  
   - Graphx : Graph compoutation engine
